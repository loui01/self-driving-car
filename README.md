# self-driving-car
self driving car.js no libraries 


 this is  a fun project that displays the workings of neural networks. the neural will steer a car through traffic and guide it in between lanes. no libraries will be used . this a tutorial lecture/project that i have always wanted to complete. 
the project is divided into the following parts 
Car driving mechanics
Road definition
Artificial sensors
Collision detection
Traffic simulation
Neural network
Visualizing neural networks
Optimizing neural networks 

To gather data about its surroundings, the car is equipped with sensors, which are contained in the sensor.js file. These sensors allow the car to detect obstacles, stay on the road, and make decisions about its speed and direction.

The car itself is represented by the car.js file, which contains all the code necessary to define the car's physical properties and behavior. The car can accelerate, brake, and turn, just like a real car, but it does so autonomously, using the neural network and sensor data to guide its movements.

The road.js file generates the road on which the car drives, and the visualizer.js file is responsible for rendering the car's movements on a canvas. The controls.js file contains the code for the car's controls, allowing you to interact with the car and test its behavior.

Finally, the main.js file is the main entry point for the project. It brings together all the other files and controls, allowing you to run the self-driving car and see it in action.
